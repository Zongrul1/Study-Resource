# Question
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

> Example:
> 
> Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,  
> 
>           5  
>          / \  
>         4   8  
>        /   / \  
>       11  13  4   
>      /  \      \  
>     7    2      1  
> return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.

# Resolution

Recurrsion is an easy way to resolute this question, the improtant condition is that the left children and the right children are also equal to zero. 
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if(root == null) return false;
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            if(sum - root.val == 0) return true;
            else return false;
        }
        return hasPathSum(root.left,sum - root.val)||hasPathSum(root.right,sum - root.val);
    }
}
