# Question
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8  
> Output: 6  
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.  
> Example 2:  
> 
> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4  
> Output: 2  
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.  

# Resolution
通过控制root的位置可解出这题，具体实现代码如下：
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        // Value of current node or parent node.
        int parentVal = root.val;

        // Value of p
        int pVal = p.val;

        // Value of q;
        int qVal = q.val;

        if (pVal > parentVal && qVal > parentVal) {
            // If both p and q are greater than parent
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        } else if (pVal < parentVal && qVal < parentVal) {
            // If both p and q are lesser than parent
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        } else {
            // We have found the split point, i.e. the LCA node.
            return root;
        }
    }
}
```
